# WIP Bee simulation for my future game, made using DOTS.
---
#### Parameters for the worst-case scenario
- Low hundreds of **Beehives**
- Each **Beehive** contains at most 600 **BeeSquds** 200 * 600 = 120,000
- Tens of thousands of **flowers**

#### Current progress fast simulation [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jFfCPzz5Y7dMGNWluuDpKLoI_0QAFORi/view?usp=drive_link)

#### Current progress Slow simulation (intended) [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FVoWj1hFmqo6VeFbdxkRGfWAuSVkKQQ/view?usp=drive_link)


### Big milestones 
- [x] create skeleton of simulation
<details>
  <summary>add new systems making simulation more complex</summary>
  
- [x] add food consumption
- [ ] When hive is shade and or isn't facing sunrise, bees go foraging later.
- [X] add mites 
- [ ] add diseases that reduce stats of the bees or the queen 
- [x] bee dying probability on curve, with different parameters affecting mortality - weather/mites/etc
- [ ] beehive size dependent on food stored 
- [x] Queen life cycle
- [x] random genes based on species 
- [ ] beehive conditions - ventilation/temperature/space/..
- [ ] control stats based on food quality - sugar lowest, natural nectar highest.
