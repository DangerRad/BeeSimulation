# WIP Bee simulation for my future game, made using DOTS.
---
#### Parameters for the worst-case scenario
- Low hundreds of **Beehives**
- Each **Beehive** contains at most 600 **BeeSquds** 200 * 600 = 120,000
- Tens of thousands of **flowers**

### Big milestones 
- [x] create skeleton of simulation
<details>
  <summary>add new systems making simulation more complex</summary>
  
- [x] add food consumption
- [ ] shade that influences start of foraging
- [ ] add mites
- [ ] add diseases
- [x] bee dying probability on curve 
- [ ] beehive size dependent on food stored 
- [ ] Queen life cycle
- [ ] random genes based on species 
- [ ] beehive conditions - ventilation/temperature/space/..
- [ ] control stats based on food quality - sugar lowest, natural nectar highest.
